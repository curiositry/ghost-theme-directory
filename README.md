The Ghost Theme Directory
=========================

The [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform is a burgeoning, and themes are being developed at breakneck speed. But the Ghost marketplace doesn’t have search, tagging, or discovery — and it features an infinite scroll that repeats themes randomly.

Aside from allghostthemes.com, which has few sort-tools to speak of, there is no third party solution.

This is my open-source solution-in-progress: a place to find the perfect free (or paid) Ghost theme for the tone of your blog.
