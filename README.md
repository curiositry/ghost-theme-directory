The Ghost Theme Directory
=========================

The [Ghost](http://ghost.org) blogging platform is new and trendy. Themes are being developed at breakneck speed, but the Ghost marketplace doesn’t have search, tagging, or discovery — and it features an infinite scroll that repeats themes randomly.

*Just free or paid themes … can we have some more options here?*

Aside from allghostthemes.com, which has few sort-tools to speak of, there is no third party solution.

This is my Open Source solution-in-progress: a place to find the perfect free (or paid) Ghost theme for the tone of your blog.
